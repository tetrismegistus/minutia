This is code based on and inspired the code in the book Mazes for Programmers.

Some notes:

1.  The reference implementation in the book was written in Ruby.  Though others have translated this book to Python before, this particular implementation is novel.
2.  Where the code in the book evolves, I have not kept old versions.  This is not meant to be a complete guide through the book.
3.  Where I have completed the exercises in the book, I have integrated them in the code without any special indication.
4.  I may have often strayed from the design specified in the book for organization or implementation reasons.
