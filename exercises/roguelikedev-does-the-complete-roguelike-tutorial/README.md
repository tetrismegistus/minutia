At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).
 
I'm following [roguelike tutorial revised](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) tutorial on Python3, rather than libtcod and python2

Requirements:
* Python 3
* libtcod

Setup Instructions:

* Depends slightly on your distribution.  Included tcod libraries are compiled for linux on a 64 bit system
